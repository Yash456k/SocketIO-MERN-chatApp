## About The Project



SocketIO-MERN-ChatApp is a modern, real-time chat application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and Socket.IO. It allows users to communicate instantly. This is a project I made to just understand how to make and deploy fullstack applications. If you find any bugs feel free to approach me on any social media platform. I know the code is a bit messy ðŸ˜… but any feedback is welcome.
